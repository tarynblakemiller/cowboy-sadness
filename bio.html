<h1>Cowboy Sadness<br>
<i>Bios</i></h1>
<p><b>LARGE</b><p>The desert is full of paradox. It's a domain of harsh realities and strange illusions, of freedom and danger, of liberation and isolation. Its terrain and climate are severe and unforgiving, only suitable for scrappy scavengers, hardened exteriors, and ascetic flora accustomed to scarcity. Yet it also contains unparalleled beauty, with vistas too expansive to fully comprehend. A lone individual is made minuscule, easily vanishing from civilization like evaporating water.</p>
<p>Pop culture has so thoroughly conditioned us to associate the desert with certain musical styles and sonic signifiers- twangy guitars, dustily-brushed drums, Morricone-esque whistles- that we rarely imagine how that vast, ragged landscape might sound without them.</p>
<p>But what is the true sound of a red-orange sun emerging just above the horizon, spilling over an open plain and baking chilled stones? Or a patch of flowering succulents behind a boulder's shade, where temperatures remain miraculously mild through the afternoon?</p>
<p>What's the sonic equivalent of a monolithic butte towering high above a vacant valley, as menacing thunderheads form in the distance? Or an overturned colander of night sky, speckled with billions of galaxies and heavenly wisps of milky way?</p>
<p>These are the questions answered by Cowboy Sadness' debut album, though they were not the ones being asked during its creation. Songs were discovered through improvisation, more akin to wandering through the desert than scoring it.</p>
<p>Cowboy Sadness formed organically after David Moore (Bing &amp; Ruth) was introduced to Peter Silberman (The Antlers) and Nicholas Principe (Port St. Willow) by a mutual friend in Brooklyn, NY in 2011. While each member was pursuing their own individual projects at the time, there was an immediate affinity for one another, a shared passion for seeking new sounds and a collective desire to create together.</p>
<p>Shortly after meeting, Nicholas, Peter &amp; David began holding epic, days-long improvisatory sessions, capturing the performances on a simple handheld field recorder. Cowboy Sadness became a release valve, a place to return to the purity of creating for creation's sake; making a kind of music free of expectations and commercial pressure.</p>
<p>By 2017, all three had independently migrated to upstate New York. Sharing a long-held intention to create an album, they set up to properly record their sessions in the more open surroundings that an escape from the city provided. In total, they amassed around 20 hours of music.</p>
<p>Over the course of several week-long mixing sessions they began the laborious task of editing down the recordings into a cohesive statement; one that still captured the space, momentum and spirit of the original sessions, but with the thoughtful editing and structure of traditional songwriting.</p>
<p><em>Selected Jambient Works Vol.1</em> is the summation of over a decade of work. The album is atmospheric yet incredibly approachable, with sounds more akin to Pink Floyd and Can than John Cage.</p>
<p>The stylistic signatures of each member are undeniable throughout: Moore's heavy, undulating organs, Silberman's melancholic guitars, and Principe's galloping, hypnotic drums travel together in easy synchronization before being subsumed into thick quicksand textures, eventually giving way to cavernous space. Upon reaching momentary silence, the band coalesces again, locking into a deep groove until overtaken by the next windstorm.</p>
<p>And these kinds of images are continually evoked across the album- a cattle stampede in "Billings, MT", a band of night-stalking coyotes in "Ten Paces", and the desolate feeling of being the only person within earshot, via the album's somber closer, "The Cowboy Way".</p>
<p>Cowboy Sadness' sprawling debut is an odyssey through vivid, mercurial environments for the listener to inhabit continuously, unpeopled landscapes where signs of life are rare, but exquisite when uncovered.</p>---<p>
